Test Case 1:   
Transaction File: test_list1.txt  
Description: This test verifies that the list correctly handles duplicate values and ensures that garbage collection only removes the exact instance that was deleted. It checks whether removing a value does not affect other instances of the same value.
Expected Output in gc.log:
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 1
Chunks still allocated: 3


Test Case 2:   
Description: This test evaluates how the garbage collector responds to frequent additions, deletions, and invocations. The test ensures that memory is cleaned up efficiently after multiple operations.
Expected Output in gc.log:
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 0
Chunks still allocated: 3
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 0
Chunks still allocated: 4
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 2
Chunks still allocated: 2
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 1
Chunks still allocated: 1

Test Case 3: 
Transaction File: test_list3.txt  
Description: This test checks if the garbage collector properly frees memory when all elements are removed. After clearing the list, garbage collection should leave no allocated chunks.

Expected Output in gc.log:
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 4
Chunks still allocated: 0


Test Case 4: 
Transaction File: test_fstree1.txt  
Description: This test ensures that hard links prevent directories from being deleted by garbage collection. Although a directory is linked elsewhere, it should remain intact after garbage collection runs.

Expected Output in gc.log:
Mark_and_sweep running  
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 0
Chunks still allocated: 4


Test Case 5:   
Description: This test verifies that deleting subdirectories properly marks them for garbage collection while leaving the remaining structure untouched.
Expected output in gc.log:
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 2
Chunks still allocated: 2


Test Case 6: 
Transaction File: test_fstree3.txt  
Description: This test evaluates whether garbage collection correctly removes unreachable directories while keeping new additions intact.

Expected Output in gc.log:
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 2
Chunks still allocated: 2
Mark_and_sweep running
Chunks freed this pass: 0
Chunks still allocated: 3
